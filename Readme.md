Don't use the optimized for size (i.e. low quality) version available on the website for printing.
Can I have the high quality STL ? No, there are plenty of foxes, but this one is mine.
Just kidding, a high quality one will be available in a few days on my thingiverse, (to avoid polluting the repo with big sized files). The buckyball STL won't be available though, but I am positive you can create some custom art with my tool.

The milled dragon was not generated using this tool, but with a previous iteration of a rastering algorithm. The dragon was my first milled in oak. I used too aggressive settings, and it failed multiple times during milling, but I managed recover it. No better way to get a hold on the MPCNC than learning to recover failed mills.
